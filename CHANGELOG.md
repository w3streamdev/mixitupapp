- **BREAKING CHANGES:**

- New authentication data is needed for all Twitch & YouTube accounts. Streamer accounts will be prompted to re-authenticate to Twitch & YouTube when logging in, while bot accounts for Twitch & YouTube will need to be manually re-connected on the Accounts page
- Due to changes with Twitch's new APIs and the up-coming shutdown of their old APIs, some functionality in Mix It Up that Twitch has not migrated to the new APIs yet will become unsupported until they have added them back. Below is a list of features that are no longer usable:

- Twitch Channel Watch Streak event command is now disabled as user watch streak notifications are not sent out via the new Twitch APIs
- $usersubplanname Special Identifier for Twitch subscription-based event commands will no longer be the customized name of a channel's sub plan and instead will be the standard name (EX: Tier 1) as the new Twitch APIs do not include that information
- Changes to how Twitch bot accounts send messages & whispers in chat no longer require an active connection to your channel, which also means bot accounts no longer process **UNIQUE** data sent to them. The only feature this applied to was processing whispers sent directly to bot accounts, which is now currently not supported. If there is enough demand for this feature, we will investigate adding support for it in the future.

- Large-scale restructure and improvements to general Streaming Platform connectivity, allowing for easier connection & disconnection of streaming platforms
- New Twitch features:

- Event commands have been added for the following features: Highlighted Message, User Intro, Power-Up Message Effect, Power-Up Gigantified Emote, and Power-Up Celebration
- Migration to Twitch's new APIs, allowing for improved connectivity to Twitch's services and providing new functionality in future updates

- New YouTube features:

- Support for multiple, active live streams on the same YouTube account (EX: Regular stream & short)
- All currently tracked, active live streams are now displayed on the Channel page
- Adding the ability to manually connect to live streams if they are not automatically detected via the Channel page

- The Meld Studio action has been added:

- The Meld Studio action allows you control functionality within Meld Studio such as changing scenes, showing/hiding layers & effects, and more
- Meld Studio can be connected to by visiting the Services page of Mix It Up

- Fixing bug with $usersubmonths not using the proper value for the continuous number of sub months for Twitch re-subscriptions
- Fixing bug with Twitch re-subscription messages not being properly assigned to the $message Special Identifier
- Fixing bug with Text to Speech actions not working correctly when used with TTS.Monster
- Fixing bug with $streamgameimage not properly working for Twitch accounts
- Fixing bug with chat messages & whispers not working correctly in some cases when a bot account is signed in. This requires users to re-connect their bot account manually on the Accounts page.
- Various quality of life & bug fixes

## v1.2.0.11-12

- Adding support for Team Incentives and Team Milestones for DonorDrive. These are usable only while the "Include Team Donations / Events" option is toggled under Services -> DonorDrive

## v1.2.0.0-1.2.0.10

- Overlay v3 functionality updates:

- **BREAKING CHANGES:**

- All Overlay Endpoints now share the same port number and instead have unique URLs associated with them. If you use more than 1 Overlay Endpoint, you will need to update the web browser sources in your streaming software to use the new URLs, which can be found under Settings -> Overlay.
- Overlay Widgets are now vastly more robust in the amount that can be customized for them. However, the differences in specific HTML formatting between old and new versions are incompatible and thus can not be directly migrated over. The vast majority of standard, drop-down or input values are converted over, but customized HTML can not be and is instead changed to the new format. All old customized HTML can be accessed from the Overlay Widgets page by editing the widget and clicking on the History button in the top-right corner of the window.
- Certain features and functionality have been removed due to their low usage and may be replaced in the future.
- The Web Page option has been removed due to low compatability with more websites, but web page can be added manually via the HTML option. Existing Web Page actions have been updated to this new setup via the HTML option.
- The Ticker Tape Overlay Widget has been removed and instead replaced with the comparable Label Overlay Widget. Due to their large differences, the Ticker Tape Overlay Widget was not migrated and must be manually re-created as a Label Overlay Widget.

- Overlay actions and widgets now have fully customizable HTML, CSS, and Javascript for users who are more adapt at web development
- Global HTML, CSS, and Javascript customization options can be set for Overlay Endpoints that will be present in all Overlay Actions & Overlay Widgets that use that Overlay Endpoint
- Adding "Run Widget Function" option to Overlay Action to allow for dynamic function triggering in Overlay Widgets
- Adding support for reference local files within an Overlay Action or Widget's code:

- By putting {LocalFile:\\FILE\_PATH} in your HTML, CSS, or Javascript, the Overlay service will handle automatically translating this to a local URL reference
- EX: {LocalFile:\\C:\Foo\Bar.png}
- EX: <img src="{LocalFile:\\C:\Foo\Bar.png}" />

- New Overlay Action Options:

- The Timer option allows for dynamic, non-interactable timers to be displayed on the Overlay
- The Twitch Clip option allows for the displaying of clips from a user stream. A known issue exists for some clips that been created witin the last month for users due to a major change Twitch performed in how clips are created and stored. Please up-vote the following User Voice to encourage Twitch to allow for this functionality: <https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310213-developers/suggestions/39228784-extend-clips-api-to-provide-the-mp4-url-so-editors>
- The Emote Effect option allow for dynamic displaying of emotes, emoticons, and images in a visual animation such as explosions and rain

- The same Overlay action will now no longer replace an old instance if it is still visible and instead will stack over it (EX: Triggering the same Overlay action 5 times in succession will now show 5 instances together rather than only 1).
- Image actions now can optionally use the native size of the image file instead of manually supplied a width and height if the fields are left blank.
- Overlay actions that use width and height now support size scaling if only a width or height is specified.
- Adding support for adding dynamic animations to Overlay Action visuals

- New Overlay Widgets:

- Label Overlay Widget

- The Label Overlay Widget allows you to display persistent information for your stream that will automatically update as changes occur.
- Common examples are for showing the latest follower, subscriber, donation, etc.

- Persistent Timer Overlay Widget:

- The Persistent Timer Overlay Widget is a combination of the previous Timer and Timer Train Overlay Widgets.

- Various options on the widget can be set to add seconds to the timer or seconds can be added dynamically via the Overlay Action -> Add To Persistent Timer.

- Wheel Overlay Widget:

- The Wheel Overlay Widget allows you to present a visual prize wheel to your stream with various outcomes that can be randomly selected
- In addition to setting the probability on each outcome, you can also set a positive or negative modifier on each outcome to adjust the probability of the outcome

- If any outcome with a negative modifier is selected, the probabilities for all outcomes are adjusted by their modifier amount
- If any outcome with a positive modifier is selected, all outcomes are reset to their initial probabilities

- Each outcome can have a customized command for it that will be triggered when the outcome is selected or the default outcome command will be triggered instead if the outcome-specific command has no actions in it
- The Wheel Overlay Widget can be triggered dynamically via the Overlay Action -> Spin Wheel

- Persistent Emote Effect Overlay Widget:

- Amazon Polly & Microsoft Azure Speech both leverage a payment model for usage of their service and as a result, we have implemented a cooldown usage to them currently of 1 each every 5 minutes. This cooldown amount may be decreased or increased over time depending on the usage and cost associated with supporting these services.
- Users can set up their own Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure account account and connect it on the Services page to remove the cooldown effect, however the linked account will then be billed for all usage of the service for Text to Speech

- Any value returned from the script is stored in the Special Identifier "$scriptresult" which can be leveraged in subsequent action.
- There is no unique functionality provided in the Script action to directly interact with Mix It Up, the Script action simply is a means to perform more complex logic in a simpler form for experience users. However, you are able to leverage the Mix It Up Developer API from inside your Script action to perform some operations within Mix It Up.
- Javascript-based scripts will run using the Mix It Up Overlay, allowing you to leverage external libraries by including them in the Overlay Endpoint via customization under Settings -> Overlay.
- Python-based scripts now require a local installation of Python on your PC by running directly via the Python interpreter. The Executable location for Python must be set under Settings -> Commands.

## v1.1.0.7-8

### **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Due to performance and memory issues we have been seeing related to animated emotes within the Chat page, we have temporarily disabled all animated emotes and they will instead be replaced with their static counter-parts. This change only affects animated emotes that are rendered on the Chat page; this does not affect anything with animated images or videos through the Overlay. We have been hard at work attempting to improve the performance of emote rendering in the app to ensure it remains responsive and we have made large improvements to the rendering of static emote images. However the libraries available to use for rendering animated emotes are not to the level of performance and memory efficiency to ensure a quality experience for our users. We will be continuing to investigate alternatives to bring back animated emotes and will keep users aware of any progress we are able to make

- BetterTTV emote support for YouTube if you have connected your YouTube account for BetterTTV and enable the feature within Mix It Up under Settings -> Chat
- YouTube supports the ability for users to have spaces in their username, which adjusts how User Special Identifiers are processed. When using any User-based Special Identifier, if the user in question has spaces in their username, then you must use an '@' before their name and the user must be presently active in your chat for us to be able to correlate them.

- Due to the naming conventions used for YouTube, there may be some confusion when using various features in Mix It Up. We are still working on the best way to help distinquish between these conflicting terms, but in the mean-time, a general rule of thumb is as follows:

- On most streaming platforms, a user that is interested notifications for your channel is called a Follower, while a person that is paying money to your stream for special perks is a Subscriber.
- On YouTube, a user that is interested in notifications for your channel is a Subscriber, while a person that is paying money to your stream for special perks is a Member.
- You'll notice that there is an overlap in terminology for Subscriber, but they don't mean the same thing. EX: Twitch Follower = YouTube Subscriber, Twitch Subscriber = YouTube Member
- Within Mix It Up, we have focused on keeping the terminology aligned with what users have been used to on most streaming platforms: Notifications => Follower, Paid User => Subscriber
- If you see anywhere in the app where it specifically says **YouTube** Subscriber, you can safely assume it means a user who is getting notifications for your channel.
- However, if it **does not** have the word YouTube in front of Subscriber, then it means a person who has paid money for perks in your channel
